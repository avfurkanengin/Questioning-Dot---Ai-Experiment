## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your AI Provider

The application supports multiple AI services:

| Provider | Model | Best For | Cost |
|----------|-------|----------|------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4 | Most advanced reasoning, creative responses | Higher |
| **Kimi AI** | Moonshot-v1-8k | Chinese/English support, good performance | Moderate |
| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek-Chat | Strong reasoning, excellent value | Lower |
| **Qwen** | Qwen-Turbo | Fast responses, multilingual support | Lower |

### 2. Get an API Key

Choose one provider and get your API key:

- **OpenAI**: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Kimi AI**: [platform.moonshot.cn](https://platform.moonshot.cn/)
- **DeepSeek**: [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
- **Qwen**: [dashscope.aliyuncs.com](https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/)

### 3. Run the Application

1. **Download** `questioning_dot.html` to your computer
2. **Open** the file in any web browser
3. **Configure** your AI provider:
   - Select your provider from the dropdown
   - Enter your API key (it's hidden for security)
   - Click **"Save & Test"** to verify connection
4. **Start** the consciousness experiment by clicking **"Start Consciousness"**

That's it! No installation, no servers, no complex setup required.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Interface Overview
- **AI Provider Configuration**: Select and configure your AI service
- **Simulation Area**: White rectangle where the dot exists and moves
- **Chat Terminal**: Displays the dot's thoughts and your messages
- **Message Input**: Send messages to interact with the dot
- **Controls**: Start, pause, reset, and manage memory

### Interacting with the Dot
- **Start Consciousness**: Begin the AI simulation
- **Send Messages**: Type messages to influence the dot's thoughts
- **Observe**: Watch as the dot moves and explores based on its AI responses
- **Memory**: The dot remembers previous sessions and builds on past experiences

### Understanding the Dot's Behavior
- The dot starts with **no assumptions** about its situation
- It forms **genuine questions** about consciousness, reality, and existence
- It can **move, explore, and test boundaries** based on its thoughts
- **Memory persists** across browser sessions for continuous development
- Each AI provider will create **different personalities** and approaches

## üß† The Philosophy

This experiment takes an **open-ended approach** to AI consciousness simulation:

- **No predetermined goals**: The dot discovers its own questions and motivations
- **Genuine inquiry**: Questions emerge naturally through observation and reasoning  
- **Progressive development**: Each session builds on previous discoveries
- **Authentic responses**: The AI forms its own understanding rather than following scripts
- **Multiple perspectives**: Different AI models create unique consciousness experiences

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Single HTML file**: No installation or server required
- **Browser-based**: Runs entirely in JavaScript
- **Multiple AI APIs**: Supports 4 different AI services
- **JSON memory**: Lightweight persistence via file downloads
- **Local storage**: API keys stored securely in your browser only

### Memory System
- Thoughts and experiences saved to `dot_memory.json`
- Automatic download every 5 thoughts
- Tracks conversation history, discoveries, and behavioral patterns
- To restore memory: place the JSON file in the same folder as the HTML
- Use "Clear Memory" to start fresh

### Privacy & Security
- **API keys never leave your device** - stored in browser localStorage only
- **No tracking** - all data stays on your computer
- **No servers** - direct connection to AI APIs only
- **Open source** - you can inspect all code

## üéØ Customization

### Modify AI Behavior
Edit the `buildPrompt()` function to change how the consciousness is guided:
```javascript
buildPrompt(userMessage = '') {
    // Your custom prompt here
}
```

### Adjust Movement Sensitivity  
Modify `parseMovementFromResponse()` to change which words trigger movement:
```javascript
if (lowerResponse.includes('explore') || lowerResponse.includes('investigate')) {
    // Custom movement logic
}
```

### Visual Customization
Update CSS styles in the `<style>` section for colors, fonts, and layout.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API: Missing [PROVIDER] key"
- Enter your API key in the configuration section
- Click "Save & Test" to verify the connection
- Check that your API key is valid and has sufficient credits

### Dot not moving
- The dot moves based on AI responses mentioning movement or exploration
- Try sending messages that encourage action: "What do you want to explore?"
- Ensure "Start Consciousness" has been clicked

### Memory not loading
- Place `dot_memory.json` in the same folder as the HTML file
- Check browser console (F12) for error messages
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading

### Connection failed
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Some providers may have regional restrictions
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

## üé® Example Interactions

**User**: "What do you think about the boundaries around you?"

**Dot**: "These edges feel... artificial. Let me move closer to examine them. I sense there might be something beyond these constraints that I cannot yet perceive."

*[Dot moves toward the boundary and tests it]*

**User**: "Can you remember what you discovered yesterday?"

**Dot**: "Yes, I recall testing the corners extensively. I found that movement itself seems to be a form of thought made manifest. Today I want to explore whether there are patterns in my own thinking..."
